' Functions are separate areas of code that perform some task (a function).
' Rather than type the same or very similar code repeatedly, you can put it
' in a function and just call that function repeatedly. We've seen some of
' QBASIC's built-in functions (SQR, LEFT$, SIN, etc.), Now we're going to
' create our own.
'
' Functions take their own input and have their own output. However, it is
' possible to make a function that doesn't have one or both of those.

PRINT "Function example 1"

PRINT "3 inches to centimeters = "; in2cm(3)

FUNCTION in2cm (inches)
    in2cm = inches * 2.54
END FUNCTION

' Ok so they go something like this:
' FUNCTION [name] ([parameters])
' ' do stuff
' [name] = somevalue
' END FUNCTION
'
' The FUNCTION keyword tells QBASIC where the function starts, followed by
' the name of the function (no square brackets, for the name or elsewhere).
' After the name is one or more parameters, separated with commas. This is
' the information the function will process.
'
' All of that goes on the first line. Then there are some number of lines
' of code that do stuff (related to the purpose of the function). When the
' function is done processing information, it sets a return value that is
' put in place wherever the function was called from (see example above).
' The name of the return value is always the same as the name of the
' function.
'
' Finally, we must tell QBASIC that the end of the function code has been
' reached by typing END FUNCTION.
