' This is a comment.
' Comments are ignored by BASIC
' Comments go until the end of the line

PRINT "first line"

' Use "whitespace" or just empty space to
' help make things clearer. Whitespace is also
' ignored by BASIC, it makes no difference to
' it how much you space things out.

' Each command has to be on a separate line though.


PRINT "Yay for comments" ' Comments can go after commands too.

' But not before commands: PRINT "this is ignored"


' Keeping comments on their own line is much better 99.9% of the time.
' The one place a comment character (single quote, apostrophe) is not
' a comment character is inside strings (double quotes).

PRINT "It's just another character inside the 'double quotes'"


REM stands for remark. It also is considered the beginning
REM of a comment and works the same way.
REM I'm explaining it here for completeness, I'd prefer you
REM use the short method (').

PRINT "Single-quote (apostrophe) >> REM"

' ============================================================
' One more thing:
'   Comments can be used visually to make things quite clear.
'   This "comment block" is pretty snazzy. Dont try to keep a
'   right border on a block like this, you'll likely go mad.
